db.io Motivation
=====

Tired of dealing with a complex ORM? Not afraid of SQL? db.io can make dealing
with JDBC less painful. db.io provides a minimal API. There's not much to get between
you and your data.

Features
---
* Specify the columns you want via plain old java interfaces. No need to
implement those pesky beans with all the getter/setter noise.

* Need migration support for your schema? A simple wrapper for liquibase is
provided.

TODO
===
* Implement named query parameters
* Test with Oracle and possible other JDBC drivers.
