\section{Goals}
This code is not intended to be some large, complex object relational mapper. 
Nor will it replace tools such as liquibase. There may be some overlap however. The core 
is focused on only a few aspects of database interaction: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Schema evolution
	\item Generating mundane code needed for database I/O
    \item DB independence, but only for DDL. It does not attempt to provide an object model for queries.
\end{itemize}

\section{Planned Components}
An external DSL that is similar, but not limited to, the typical DDL supported by most databases. 
The DSL will provide the metadata needed for various types of code generation. The code 
generation will probably be a combination of textual code gen via StringTemplate and class file 
creation with the assistance of cglib, or something similar. Clojure's gen class is another possibility.
